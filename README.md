# OnStep_M5StickC_PLUS2_SHC

This is upgraded version of the code from this topic in OnStep group: https://onstep.groups.io/g/main/message/52115
I've added diagonal movement, more speeds, go-to to sun in one click

Those are the hardware parts for the hand controller. I've bought them from AliExpress:

You need to configure the stickc-plus2 using ULFlow (not UIFlow 2.0!), follow this instructions to do that:
https://docs.m5stack.com/en/uiflow/m5stickc_plus2/program

After you have UIFlow connected to stickc-plus2 controller, move to "python" section, paste the code, and try to run.

Get attention to update the SSID and PASS if needed (username and password of your OnStep's wifi), and try 9998 port instead of 9999, if 9999 doesn't work.
